# Repair-Environment.ps1

Configuring a development environment shouldn't take hours or days, and shouldn't require lots of manual steps.

This repository contains a set of useful base scripts to help you automate this in your team.

## How this would work on your project

When a new developer joins your project:

    C:\code> git clone git@github.com:corporate/SomeProject.git
    Cloning into 'SomeProject'...
    Receiving objects: 100%, done.
    
    C:\code> cd SomeProject
    
    C:\code\SomeProject> Repair-Environment.ps1
    Problem: IIS site missing for www.site.localtest.me
    Fix applied: IIS site created for www.site.localtest.me
    
    Problem: SSL binding missing for www.site.localtest.me
    Fix applied: SSL binding added for www.site.localtest.me
    
    Problem: IIS site missing for services.site.localtest.me
    Fix applied: IIS site created for services.site.localtest.me
    
    All tests now passing (fixes were applied)
    If you are still experiencing an issue, diagnose the problem then add more tests here to prevent it in the future

When you've just pulled new code, then your environment broke because another developer introduced a new dependency:

    C:\code\SomeProject> git pull
    
    C:\code\SomeProject> Repair-Environment.ps1
    Problem: Back connection hostname missing for service.site.localtest.me
    Fix applied: Back connection hostname added for service.site.localtest.me
    
    All tests now passing (fixes were applied)
    If you are still experiencing an issue, diagnose the problem then add more tests here to prevent it in the future

When you're not sure if it's your environment or your code that's broken:

    C:\code\SomeProject> Repair-Environment.ps1
    
    All tests passed (no fixes required)
    If you are still experiencing an issue, diagnose the problem then add more tests here to prevent it in the future

## How to add this to your project

1. Download the contents of this repository
2. Copy everything except `README.md` into the root of your project's working copy
3. Commit everything into _your_ repository
4. Modify `Repair-Environment.ps1` to contain the rules that you need
5. Do not modify `RepairEnvironmentModules` directly, or you will lose the ability to upgrade our helpers

## How to upgrade in future

1. Run your existing `Repair-Environment.ps1` to make sure it is passing
2. Download the contents of this repository again
3. Copy the `RepairEnvironmentModules` folder across to your project's working copy (do not copy `Repair-DevelopmentEnvironment.ps1`: ours is just a template)
4. Run your existing `Repair-Environment.ps1` to make sure it is passing
5. Commit everything into _your_ repository

## How to write new test and fix scripts

We keep the test and fix scripts in modules, separate from the `Repair-Environment.ps1`. This way, we can all work together on GitHub to write and improve them independently of each of our own projects.
